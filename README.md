# MovieRecs
Code for a Movie Recommendation System that functions based on user input.

Data came from list of movies on Kaggkle. Link is -> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/tmdb-movies-dataset-2023-930k-movies/versions/452?resource=download
Organized data into a csv file and took the top 100000 movies as below that the movies began to get odd. 
Code works as intended, however might be limited to data on the movies (Wrong ratings, incorrect duration, etc.)
I organized the data into specific files which I placed into Resources, just for ease of use.
